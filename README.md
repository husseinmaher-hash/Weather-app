# Frontend Mentor - Weather app

![Design preview for the Weather app coding challenge](./preview.jpg)

## Welcome! 👋

**To do this challenge, you need a good understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.**

## Technologies to Use

This project should be built using the following technologies:

- **HTML** - For structuring the content and layout of the weather app
- **CSS** - For styling the application to match the provided designs
- **JavaScript (JS)** - For implementing the interactive functionality and API integration
- **TypeScript (TS)** - For type-safe JavaScript code and better development experience

You can use TypeScript alongside JavaScript, or convert your JavaScript code to TypeScript for enhanced type checking and IntelliSense support.

## The challenge

Build a weather app using the [Open-Meteo API](https://open-meteo.com/) and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Your users should be able to:

- Search for weather information by entering a location in the search bar
- View current weather conditions including temperature, weather icon, and location details
- See additional weather metrics like "feels like" temperature, humidity percentage, wind speed, and precipitation amounts
- Browse a 7-day weather forecast with daily high/low temperatures and weather icons
- View an hourly forecast showing temperature changes throughout the day
- Switch between different days of the week using the day selector in the hourly forecast section
- Toggle between Imperial and Metric measurement units via the units dropdown
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## Getting started

### What's included

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design.

**In your download:**
- Mobile and desktop designs (JPG format)
- All required assets in the `/assets` folder
- Variable and static font files (or link to Google Fonts)
- `style-guide.md` with colors, fonts, and other design specs

### API setup

This project uses the [Open-Meteo API](https://open-meteo.com/) to fetch weather data.

**Good news:** Open-Meteo is completely free and doesn't require an API key! You can start making requests right away.

- **API Documentation:** [https://open-meteo.com/en/docs](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs)
- **No rate limits** for reasonable personal use
- Example endpoint: `https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast?latitude=52.52&longitude=13.41&current_weather=true`

Check their documentation for all available weather parameters and location search capabilities.

## Building your project

Feel free to use any workflow that you feel comfortable with. Below is a suggested process, but do not feel like you need to follow these steps:

1. Initialize your project as a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/). Creating a repo will make it easier to share your code.
2. Look through the designs to start planning out how you'll tackle the project. This step is crucial to help you think ahead for CSS classes to create reusable styles.
3. Before adding any styles, structure your content with HTML. Writing your HTML first can help focus your attention on creating well-structured content.
4. Write out the base styles for your project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`.
5. Start adding styles to the top of the page and work down. Only move on to the next section once you're happy you've completed the area you're working on.

**Have fun building!** 🚀
